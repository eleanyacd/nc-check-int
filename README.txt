== nc-check-int

Rishi's check interface thing. It goes along side the NC Classifier to 
provide some peripheral stats and things about loan approvals. Also 
capable of providing a baseline for loan default probability itself.

== Files

 - nc-check.rb
 - nc-check.test.rb

== Notes

* loan principle is actually principle + interest?
* the test cases have been moved from below the file to the 
corresponding .test.rb file

== Outstanding Issues

None so far!
